"Good luck finding a reasonably priced band replacement. I ordered the band from the dealer who sold it to me (no one else in town could get one) and Skagen sent the wrong one.  I guess I'll try again, but not allowing anyone else to make bands for your unique watch design seems stupid. I will certainly never buy one again.",1
No i get dark on the first week with me!! I will never buy this item and i had buy 5 of them,1
I dont know if mine was a mistake but it clearly states aqua so im confused why mine is lime green. I hate lime green and am very irritated. This is why people hate ordering on amazon. Ive spent 100s of dollars on here latey and this one will make me not want to order.  At least its not much money. Just annoying thinking u ordered something and get something else.  Well its going in the trash...,1
"The rod that holds the bracelet broke several times and the company do not fix it, it is sitting on the drawer so I can come to see the Jeweler to try to fix one more time. Don't buy it. Really. Don't buy it, It is headache.",1
"I bought 2 watches , one watch doesnot work at all, other watch  runs, its time slows down 5-10 minutes backward. Outwardly the watches look beautiful, it doesnot show time . I don't know why you are selling these kind of watches online. It is a waste my money and time that I bought these watches.",1
"This watch would have been fantastic, if it hadn't been so hard to set up, and actually worked properly. It took so many tries to get it into the mode where we could set up hours/minutes. Finally we did that, then the watch screen wouldn't dim anymore, eventually it got to the point where all of the lights turned off, and would not come back on. I would recommend to anyone that is considering buying this watch, to spend a little extra money, and get one that is better quality. With this one....you basically get what you paid for....not a whole lot.",1
"I have this watch. It looks and feels heavy duty. But for this price you know they skimmed somewhere. The digital innards are as if somebody was deliberately trying to annoy you. The chime goes off every hour and cannot be turned off. Trust me I have tried. I read the instructions forward and backward and Googled it. It just doesn't turn off. And the pitch of the chime is so loud and piercing. I seriously stored this thing in a drawer to hide the sound but it still could be heard throughout the house. I finally just took it out back and gave it a whack with the hammer like an old farm animal needing to be put down.  I didn't want to throw it away and take the chance of it haunting me all night from the trash can, disrupting my sleep. Do not buy this brand of watch. You will regret it.",1
What the hell! I just got the watch today but when I took it out the box the arms indicating the time were pointing different directions like if it's loose! I want a refund or at least an exchange!,1
"I am mechanically inclined but cannot get this unit to work on my watches.  Tried it on 3 and it scratches the back case each time, plus it only has 2 prongs so lining it up is very difficult and the tightening mechanism just doesn't get the prongs in place with any accuracy.  For the price I will not return, but I suggest you buy a 3 prong Opener, that is what I am doing.",1
It didnt work right out from the box. I had to spend few dollars to replace its battery at the jewllers. Now it seem to work OK,1
This was the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. The watch was OK but the straps were terrible. Two of them broke when I was putting them on so it left me with just one.The one I was left with was very uncomfortable. I purchased this item because I liked the idea of being able to have the different bands to wear on different days. The quality of the bands was so poor I never had the chance. I should have listened to the other negative reviews I read before I purchased this terrible product. It would have saved me some momey.,1
"I received watch yesterday and its not working. I dont know if it is battery issue but its not working.<br />No use of this watch for me. I dont have time to return it back as I am traveling back to india tomorrow :(<br /><br />Its aweful, wasted my money.",1
"Love the watch...it's beautiful, but sadly it keeps getting condensation in the face even though it's water resistant :(",1
I got this watch for x-may from my husband cause I wanted it so bad. Its only the 30th and the band is gray. I am very upset. I called the company and they said that they are taking them off the market. If the store does not take it back they said that they will give you a new one.<br />I am not happy cause I love this watch,1
"It is a good thing I didn't pay the full $50+ for this thing, $30+ was too much. I have three watches under $15 that are great, unlike this one. It has a faux tourbillon look that is really cheesy in person. The crown guard is cheap plastic and the tiny plastic nub that holds it down shears off the first time you set it. The band was too short for my tiny wrist, the only watch I ever bought in my life like that, and it looks like leather, but is a cheap gummy plastic that doesn't want to bend and conform to the wrist's shape. The leather veneer scratches off of the band with your fingernail. It is a self winding watch and you can't go more than eight hours without wearing it or it runs out. I had the watch eight days before it started losing time to the tune of 12 minutes per hour. Eight days of disappointment, and then into the garbage can.",1
"The first day I wore the watch the plastic casing felled off. I know it was only $14.99, I still though it would make it pass day 1.",1
I recieved the product with watchband parched and cracking!<br /><br />There is no way to return the product since I bought this watch during a work travel to US!,1
hola me gustaria saber que ha pasado con este reloj y tambien me gustaria cambiar la direccion me podrian decir como hacer,1
Excelent watch but the bands is very bad. is not sustainable and if it breaks no replacement. for the price you can buy other better durability,1
Cheap product,1
Its very harsh<br />broke it before use it<br />am very diappointed<br />Dont buy it my child wait for it for long time and now its broke,1
"This watch is crap.. it arrived missing some of the crystals, the buttons on the side are just decoration because they do not work, since this watch is not actually luminous like advertised. The hands also get stuck. I wouldn't reccomend this brand not even to my worst enemy.",1
"I had to return it because it wasn't working,and with all respect;I think that the sender should assure that all items is good before he or she sent it.",1
It stopped working a week after I used it. The second handle not ticking!!! The sticker in the back says ' replace Battery Jan 2015' !!!!<br />Please don't waste your money! Avoid!!!!!,1
The top of this product quit working 2 weeks after the return date.  DO NOT PURCHASE.  You will be disappointed!,1
We purchased this watch in December of 2012 for over $400 and within 2 months had to send it in for warranty work because it would not keep time.  Here we are 6 months later and it is again losing time and now the chrono feature does not work correctly.  Extremely disappointed and will never purchase anything Swiss Army again.,1
leather too hard won't wrap around your wrist I sent it back,1
Buy a better one this is plastic and pot metal I broke it after 2 uses.,1
"Most of what has been written is quite accurate.  The watch face is big (But that is what I wanted) and I did have to get several links removed, but it fits fine.  The only downer is the band.  It seems to be trash.  The black had rubbed off on sections on only the 3rd day I had worn it.  I will inevitably have to replace the band.  Also, the band feels cheap and super lightweight, compared to the face which has a nice heft to it.  I will still recommend a buy for this price ($65) when I got it... that is sixty-five and zero pennies in case this is edited out.  But you will need a better band.<br /><br />UPDATE (5/1/11)<br />I have now owned this watch for 4 months and the clasp that holds the band closed is broken.  The pin that holds it one slides in and out and doesn't even seem long enough to make it end to end, making me think a portion is broken off.  Very disappointed.",1
"I bought this watch case for my boyfriend for his birthday.  I was so excited to recieive it after researching through many different options.  When I opened the box from Amazon I was extremely disappointed.  The watch box has a shiny black finish and there were smudges, nicks, even an actual gouge in the side of it.  It looked like some one put it through  some abuse.  I was very sad , because I think it would be a great watch box if it had not been so damaged.  I'm not sure how anyone in the quality dept for this company would let the watch box even be released for shipment.  it was that bad! :(  thank goodness I did not have it shipped directly as a gift, I would have been embarrassed.    Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it and I ordered another one from another company.  It's too bad, because now I risk it not being here on time for the birthday if I do not pay extra shipping.",1
"My daughter loved the design of the watch and was excited when it arrived.  Unfortunately, after only one day of use, the band detached from the watch face and when hitting the ground the face cracked.  I would expect a product made for children would be built to handle rougher use.",1
Doesn't work. It came with a battery and i set the but it doesn't keep time. Within approx 3 hours its off by 15 minutes.  Within 24 hours its off by a couple hours.,1
Nope,1
"BEST S*** WATCH ACQUISITION IN MY LIFE, the crown is bent not out, and it has gone<br /><br />Design and termination OK<br /><br />Quality and Function S***",1
I ordered one from their site in November. When the watch arrived the numeral seven tritium did not illuminate. I had to call them and three days later they mailed me a return label. They said that as soon as they received it they would send me another. Almost two weeks later I received the new watch which had deep nick marks on the case. Again I had to call them to get return labels. Well I had it with them and sent them an e-mail and photos of the watch that they were trying to pass off as new. I contacted Paypal who opened up a formal complaint and they got the refund from the dishonest company. Shame on Marathon Watch!!,1
"The watch looks fantastic and the movement is quite smooth. I compared it to a friends swiss movement automatic watch and it is comparable. However I have several gripes. First is the band, clearly it is designed for wrists in Japan because it is short. I can barely fit it with the last hole in the band when most other brands leave me 3 or 4 holes. I wrote the company and their only response was to put another hole in it...on a $380 watch and that is the best response they can come up with. Second is the power reserve meter has been wildly inconsistent. It will often stick at a particular location and will not \\""charge\\"" anymore. At the same time it will often drain at 2x the actual rate. For instance I would take it off in the evening and pick it back up in the morning. It should have only lost about 10-12 hours on the meter but often showed that it had lost 25 hours!<br /><br />I finally decided to return the watch to Orient USA only to have them say because it has been worn it is not returnable. There is no way to know if the power reserve meter works unless you WEAR IT! On top of that it clearly states in their return policy that a defective watch can be refunded if returned within 30 days. I only wore it for about a week so I am well within the 30 days. I have sent it back to them with the expectation that I will get refunded the purchase price. Since I paid using my Paypal account I am also filing a complaint with them in hopes that they will no give me any grief.<br /><br />UPDATE-Orient USA wants to charge me $30 for a new band in order to give me a refund. Combined with the $10 cost in shipping, I would be out $40! What a load of crap, buyer beware of this company...questionable product and piss poor customer service.",1
I got my watch since one month ago and it is not working well. It delays fifteen minutes a week,1
"Watch is terrific, finding a replacement for the leather strap impossible. Amazon.com is no help, more like deceptive. You search for Skagen replacement watch bands, get sent to Amazon, & only find the watches themselves, no replacement watchbands. What's that about?",1
cheap junk,1
It's hard to wear looks nice but no sense warring is not easy at all,1
"I had this watch one month when one of the crystal fell out.  I called customer service and followed the directions to send the product back for repair.  A month later I have called twice to check on the status of the watch and now I am getting the run around.  I left a message for a return call which never happened.  I called back and Anthony, an employee in the repair department, said he would check on it for me and call me back.  Of course that never happened.    I WARN everyone and Amazon don't order products by bellagio, avalon or pedre its the same place.      Amaazon needs to check into these people before they are held liable for something.  They are now on warning.    The people and product SUCKS!!!",1
The watch was delivered with a few scratches on the outer edge of the unidirectional bezel. I was disappointed to receive a new watch already scratched.,1
No warranty card at the box....,1
Only runs half the time.  Runs for three or four hours then stops.  The crystal broke after 1 week.  Don't waste your money.,1
"I've owned several Timex watches over the years, and they all had a similar problem.  The crown when you pull it out half-way to set the date just would not work after a while.  And now, with the added features of this one, they all seem to go wrong.  Heck, it wont even keep the correct time any more.  The compass only works if you set it on a completely flat, level surface, and the temp is only accurate if you leave it off your wrist for an hour or so.  Whats the point in having a wristwatch with features that only (barely) work when you take it off?  Timex just doesnt make quality products, I just never knew it until I bought a watch that was actually made well.",1
dont work as whach ck only work as battery ck??????????????????????/???????<br />the price its good shiping its very fast.thank any way,1
1 of the 2 watches was not running please send me a battery for it ... not sure if the battery is the problem or not,1
"The watch was OK, but the clasp was not as described on Amazon, so I did not want it. Sent the watch back in accordance with sellers specs, AND NEVER RECEIVED A REFUND. Seller does not respond to phone calls.  VERY UNHAPPY!!!!!",1
"2 B r not 2 B<br /><br />Watch has so much moisture inside after 2 swims, that I cannot read the display. Have had many versions of Timex Ironman watches over the years, and this is the first time, it failed so soon. Must be a manufacturing defect. Returning, and will try a different one.",1
I took a chance on the mixed reviews and ended up disappointed. I already own a very similar watch and the silicone that holds the strap in place had broken. I found it was cheaper to buy a new watch than just a band. Of course this was too good to be true. It's not the pretty pale pink in the picture (somewhere between pale and bright pink) and the paint on the edges of the face was coming off as soon as I tried to pry of the back to change the dead battery. One of the cz stones was about to fall out. I have no problem with a less expensive watch (i'm not one for expensive jewelry of any kind) but this thing is garbage. Don't bother.,1
Too big--sorry I bought it.  I would like to return it to you.,1
"The description of this watch was \\""unidirectional bezel.\\""  However, the watch lacked a moveable bezel.  That was the feature in which I was most interested.  So, no, this was NOT a good experience.",1
I ordered the watch pictured up top but received  a totally different watch. When I went back to reorder they had a totally different price for the watch,1
"bad item parts where missing 3 parts, I had to go to my local watch store and spend $ 10 in order to use this product, I tried calling amazon to get a replacement, but they stated that was the last one they had.",1
"This is a very nice watch. Unfortunately, I had to return it because there were no instructions on how to remove the links. The watch would've fit 2 people the way it came.",1
"THIS PRODUCT IS VERY POOR QUALITY, DO NOT RECOMMEND. MIGHT BE VERY CHEAP BUT NOT WORTH TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT WORK",1
"Garbage - tools were chipped when they arrived, and materials are so flimsy even the metal parts chip off easily",1
I didn't purchase the watch from Amazon but had the same issue of time loss due to the watch stopping. Took it off for a few days then I noticed. Visually the watch has the look but you need the engine running properly. Lots of bad watches coming out of invicta lately. Glad my older purchases are running fine as I have invested lots into my collection from Invicta. My advice: Test all your watch functions for a few days before keeping them.,1
I can't find a BT notify app that will do all you guys say this watch  should be  doing  very disappointed in the watch cause it doesn't work,1
This is the 2nd of these watches I've ordered. The stem is not protected so it arrives w/almost no battery left. The 1st one lasted about 2 months...the 2nd one barely 2 weeks. I will never buy another one.,1
"I like the overall look of the watch, but the materials are very cheap. Does not look like it will withstand every day wear. Wish I did not purchase.",1
I bought this watch and returned it because it intermittently stopped working so I sent it back. Received it's replacement a few weeks later. It stopped working intermittently again. Was going to return it but I was a week out of the 30 day replacement period. I'm not a very satisfied customer! I thought Casio was a pretty good company or maybe these watches are sent as old merchandise with dated batteries. Frustrated!,1
"I bought this watch one month ago and it was not a good choice.<br />The delivery was perfect but the item was cheap and not working.<br />As I tried to adjust the hour on my new watch I pulled the crown out with precaution but it directly goes out, the all part !<br />So now, I have a new watch, i didn't use it once she's waiting to go to the repair shop. about 80$ plus repair cost !<br /><br />Be careful with Android company.",1
"Looks nice, but within literally five minutes the chain broke and the cover will not stay shut.  Very cheap.  I am returning.",1
"This is the worst experience I've ever had shopping online. I bought this watch because I thought it was going to be a great Christmas present for my mother until I found out this watch was fake, a very precise replica that people wouldn't be able to tell unless is taken to a store and compared to another watch of the same series. I want my money back. This is a scam!!!!",1
Watch defective...even new battery didn't help.  Seller refunded $ promptly.  Will not order another.,1
"Took a month to arrive and doesn't work. Can't be bothered to pay to return, so I'm just throwing it away. Waste of time and money",1
I had the watch for less than a month and the clasp completely broke. I did like that the hands on the watch glowed in the dark.,1
This was a gift for my husband.  It never worked.  We sent it in for repairs and it would be gone for months at a time.  When it was sent back it still never worked.  We did this three times.  Finally I took it to a local watch repairman and he couldn't fix it either  It's now two years later with all the sending back and forth and to late to return it!  Very bad!,1
"This watch is really poor quality. The watch band started cracking and splitting a week after continuous wear, as other reviewers have noted.  Also, for the first few days the watch worked fine. Then, the plastic covering the face popped off, no idea how this happened. After that, the watch kept stopping, I had to reset it many times, and then about one month after receiving it and less than 2 weeks of wearing it on a daily basis, it quit altogether. I am going to contact Amazon to see wht kind of credit I might be able to get. If I has to do it again, I definitely would NOT BUY THIS WATCH.",1
"This is NOT what you will get if you order this tool kit; instead, you'll get this:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Optima-55-046-Complete-Repair-Watch/dp/B009OWWVPW/ref=sr_1_12?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1436466779&sr=1-12<br />The kit I received had about half of the tools that are in the picture, a cheap plastic link remover, no hammer or hand puller, plus a lot of other pieces were just plain missing. And, instead of the nice black leatherette case with the tan lining, the tools arrived in a cheap aluminum-and-lexan hard case, which was just tacky.<br />I sent it back and requested the tool kit I ordered, and Amazon sent me another of the exact same piece of crap. Until Optima and Amazon figure out what what the heck is going on with this product, my advice is that you do not order it, unless you really like being disappointed.",1
"The quality of the product isn't that good for a 85$ watch. The functions aren't working properly (the day and date), also the pin that I'm suppose to change these info aren't working too (it's suppose to have 2 stages but has just one, to change the hour only).",1
"Worked for about 1 hour, then quit.",1
Heavy...too  heavy,1
"Junk watch, but then again it was less than 20 bucks.",1
Thos os the worst thing I have ever bought on amazon. I received it at first without battery and this is not usual. I went to watches store and wanted to put a battery and they told me the electricity stuff inside the watch was full of sulfate because the battery was inside for long time and now doesnt works it needed to chaged all the electric system to work again then I paid a lot more for this new system. Is the worst item i have ever bought really this never happen to me and will never happen again for sure. Never buy this.,1
"Don't waste your money on this watch. I tried to set the time and battery died immediately, after I I just got it in the mail. There's a possibility that you will get the exact same watch that I returned to Amazon, and hopefully with a new battery. ;)",1
Timex used to make great watches that lasted a long time. But in recent years the quality has gone down tremendously. The last 4 or 5 timex watches we've bought in our household have lasted a year or less. I keep buying them becasuse there are very few women's sport watches with interval timers and the other ones are chunky and not at all stylish. This one at least bridges the gap on style and is not too big so I can wear it most of the time. But it really irritates me that the quality is so bad.,1
"I bought this Casio watch for casual use to replace a Casio I had used several years.  One of the features I wanted was enough water-resistance to go into a swimming pool and wade into the ocean.  The watch was never more than 5 feet under water, but water droplets appeared inside the watch face within several days.  They did dry out, but then a piece of the plastic fell off, and the watch band was no longer functional.  I don't expect a $13.48 watch to last forever, but I thought it should last more than 2 weeks.",1
"Looks great, but the chronograph doesn't work....I dont know if was the saller that sold me a broken one, or the watch is a POS..",1
I BY THIS WACH  FOR MAY  WIFE  IS LOOKED VERY CHEAPER ; I DONT LIKE  .  L CAN SAID  IF  YOU WANNA  BY  SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOUR WIFE  DONT BY THIS WACH,1
"Loved how this watch looked and fit, but had two problems:    1. the installed light uses up the battery a lot which I needed to replace too often.  2. It broke, couldn't be fixed without spending more than the watch was worth! Had to throw it out!",1
I never got the Jason Taylor invicta case! :( the order should have came wit a Invicta Jason Taylor Big Plastic Case.,1
"Would not recommend ordering this watch.  I received a watch, however it was not the gold one pictured; I received one that was silvertone, and looked and felt Cheap.",1
Stopped working after two days. Poorly made. A complete disappointment...,1
"After trying for 3 hours to set the time, without success, I returned it to Amazon for credit.",1
Returned said watch as it did not work properly.  Half of the face failed to light up. It was not a battery problem as I had a professional jeweler advise me on it.,1
Definite quality control problems. The second hand (sweep hand) randomly wobbles and causes the minute hand to get stuck about once a day. Unreliable wristwatch. Amazon has placed this item &#34;under review&#34; and has temporarily ceased selling it. This one is going back.,1
Within two days of delivery I returned home to Jamaica and had to change the battery and adjust the second hand as it was sticking to the glass,1
I had this watch in my possession for 48 hours and the crown fell out and the automatic movement and second hand froze.,1
"I bought this clock specifically because it featured a silent movement and is made by Seiko, a company I trusted.  It is very stylish looking, and has a nice glass crystal.  The numbers and hands are very legible from across the room.  I have owned this clock for two years.  It does continue to work and keep accurate time.  However...  For the first year or so, it was completely quiet.  After that, it started making a soft rattling sound that increased in volume over the months.  It is not super loud, but can be heard from about 10ft away.  Upon examination, I see that a small plastic pinion gear attached to the motor no longer meshes completely with the gear it drives, as it has worn down.  The worn gear makes a faint grinding noise as it rotates.  If it wears down further, I anticipate it will jam and the clock will stop running.  This is unacceptable for a $50 clock.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the movement is Chinese made, and labeled &#34;SKP&#34;, which is Seiko's branding.  According to Seiko's Hong Kong SKP movement website (search for &#34;Seiko HK movement&#34;), their sweep movements are made in China, and their step movements are made in Japan, for those who may have a preference when shopping for other models.  Either due to a Freudian slip or poor translation skills, their website proudly proclaims &#34;1990 was the time that Japanese movement to battle with newcomers from Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong. In order to win against those competitors, Seiko developed a new wall clock movement series. The Concept is to make the most competitive movement in the world... The perfect balanced movement between quality and cost, by ... #2: Minimizing quality of parts.  Replaced as many parts to plastic as possible and minimized metal parts unless it's really impossible to be replaced to plastic.&#34;  I'd say they need to re-do their assessment, because using metal instead of plastic for the motor gear would result in a product that outlasts its one-year warranty and improves customer retention...<br /><br />For those who want to try to fix their clock by swapping out the movement: the model is 44704E, which according to the above website is as follows: case 14mm thick, minute hand shaft 11.4 mm long, center screw (shaft) height 4.5 mm, dial fixing mode is center screw, and hand fixing mode is press fit.  Replacement movements can be found online.  The ticking types cost about $7 and the sweep second ones are about $14.warranty and improves customer retention...<br /><br />For those who want to try to fix their clock by swapping out the movement: the model is 44704E, which according to the above website is as follows: case 14mm thick, minute hand shaft 11.4 mm long, center screw (shaft) height 4.5 mm, dial fixing mode is center screw, and hand fixing mode is press fit.

"I was not very happy with the watch.  I bought it with the name of a dive watch, and the thought of resistant up to 20bar.  Well i took this on a dive the other day.  Went down to 40ft for about 40min.  Finished my dive and went up washed off my gear and my self.  Got home and checked the time to see how much more time i had till work and low and behold my watch had stopped.  Now i am out $255, and citizen refused to repair my watch.  They said it isn't ment for diving.",1
"I wanted a simple no frills watch that would be practical and casual. The military-style look seemed to evoke that, and unlike other brands I figured Timex knew what they were doing.     On the ninth day I owned my watch, I was doing yardwork and when I came inside the glass piece covering the watch face had broken off along with the second hand. I was picking up sticks and raking. Will never buy another Timex product again.",1
"This kit is absolute junk.  First off, the blue dye on the plastic parts that are blue rubbed off onto my hands and stained them.  Soap does not remove the stain.  The case wrench that came with this is completely useless.  The teeth on the wrench do not line up horizontally, and it's designed in a way that you can only adjust how wide apart the teeth are, not the height of either one.  Since mine aren't aligned horizontally the tool is 100% useless.  This is the bottom of the barrel, &#34;get what you pay for&#34; Chinese-made garbage.  Don't waste your money on this.  Spend a little more and get each tool you need individually, pay a little more and get quality tools.",1
"The watch glass broke on me. I sent it in for warranty. It did it again. Dito. By the third time I spent too much on shipping and basically had paid for the watch twice. It was still broken, gave up, and will never buy Skagen again.",1
The band looks black on the screen but was gray which I didn't like.<br />Had to return the watch at my expense.,1
"It was a cheap looking,  bad quality watch.  The offer said retails for 79 dollars, I don't believe that for a minute.",1
The Clock is an imitation,1
This product did not fit my G-Shock as advertised!,1
I was very disappointed when I opened up the package only to find that the battery was dead.  I tried to change the battery myself and ended up breaking the watch in the process.  What a waste!  Wayne,1
"I send it back and ask for a reimbursement ... however, it was faboulously beatiful adn the case is pretty and look classy.",1
it is very light and small it is not good for even medium lady when i tried it i feel that is is like toys.,1
"So I go ahead and order the Angel edition Invicta watch for my girfriend and I just realized that while I'm adjusting the time, the INVICTA logo is wrong! It reads NVITCA instead. Is it a &#34;fake&#34; or just a manufacturing error ?",1
"I have bough several Timex watches.  The last few I purchased have been big disappointments.  The watch band breaks in a few months or less.  I have to purchase and alternative band and the watch becomes usable again.  Generally, I would say the quality of the Easy Reader watches is declining.",1
This is very cheap. I thought it was a wall clock not the size of a 50 cent piece.  The description of product is not clear.,1
It's really bad watch I can't set the time properly this watch too big for me,1
"The instructions tiny tiny (hard to read) and ultimately did not clearly explain how to do things ...so many buttons, so little time! Life's too short..this baby went back.",1
"Purchased this knowing that, being made in China, it would probably be junk.  But it was for a teenager taking a trip so I wanted something inexpensive.  Product arrived with a non-functioning battery...no big deal, replaced it, however, the hands didn't work properly either, so it immediately became worthless.  What do you want for $6.00?  Sending back today.  Don't even bother purchasing, it's not worth the hassle.",1
Hard to read.  Backlight is poor. Setting is complicated. It looks good but that is all.,1
"I ordered the watch and returned it a short time later because the stem fell out.  I received a replacement, which was out of warranty in January.  A few days ago the stem fell out of it too.  Buyer beware, this watch is a dud.",1
Watch unwearable.  The braids were not joined together at one point and impossible to fix.  Will have to find a new band.,1
"I would not buy anyting Invicta under any circumstance, the minute hand on my watch fell off within 2 months of owning it and they wanted me to pay for shipping to and from their company to repair it which was over $45 they are an embaressement of a watch company.",1
Just a bad experience with this seller. Ordered the watch with a Blue Face. They shipped the black face watch. Still tried to set it up. The box included the directions for a different T Touch watch. I downloaded the correct instructions off the Tissot website. The watch time is supposed to be set at the factory. It was not and it turns out that the battery was dead. Shipping it back. So much for buying watches on Amazon.,1
"I did purchase a brand new item and the one I did received was clearly a USED ONE, I AM VERY DISAPOINTED WITH WHOM FULFIELD MY ORDER<br /><br />THE SCREW AT 7 IS MISSING<br /><br />I AM REALLY WAITING FOR AN EXPLANATION<br /><br />Eugene Barquet",1
I purchased the watch for my wife in December 2013 and it has already stopped working. I would not recommend this watch.,1
"Beautiful watch, but the watch slipped out of my hand while I was putting it on and it ended up on the floor.  I picked it up and all the numbers and the Invicta logo was &#34;floating&#34; inside the watch freely.  The watch still broke, but all the numbers and letters rattle around freely.  I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone.  I wouldn't buy this watch again.  I just bought a citizen watch to replace this one.",1
This watch came with directions written only in Chinese. What a pain! We can't figure out how to use it or set it. It is going back!,1
"I have read the reviews prior buying this watch.Even though the reviews on this product was not good,I ordered this thinking atleast this time ,they will ship a good one.But I got the watch which was not at all functioning.It is gift to my mother in law.Got fed up with this!!Please dont buy this!",1
"Looked nice, just happened to break after a week.",1
"This was to be my first \\""expensive\\"" watch. I hadn't worn a watch since I was a little kid (I'm 21 now) and I was looking for something to wear out to serious events. The watch came rather quickly through the mail and I opened the box eagerly to examine it.    Having little experience with watches, I'd say this watch was a little too big for me. I knew I wanted a large watch that would grab attention, but this was just a bit big for my wrist. I was prepared to make due with this anyways.    I pulled out the knob to set the time and date (as per the instructions) and the whole pin ended up coming out of the watch. I tried to reinsert it, but whatever was holding it in place must have came loose and it stopped working entirely. Luckily, I spoke to an Amazon representative who said they are going to refund my money and pay for the return shipping. I won't be buying this brand again.",1
"I had the same problem as another reviewer where after 2 months the watch started getting slow by several minutes a day. I replaced the battery, didn't help. Sent it to the manufacturer for repairs, and they sent it back claiming to have fixed it, but the problem persisted. And I was out the shipping & handling costs. It is nice-looking, but not a good timepiece.",1
"The instructions leave a lot to be desired but eventually you'll figure it out, it only lights up when it wants to, it usually won't light when you go to show it off",1
"I agree with most of the reviews. The design is OK but the watch is really hard to read, even with a direct light on it. Huge Disappointment!",1
In the past I had good experience with Timex watches and decided to buy an Expedition Trail to replace my Casio. The watch arrived promptly and set up easily. After a week it shut off and was dead. I contacted Amazon and within a few days a new watch arrived. I opened the box and the replacement watch was missing the mode button! Two strikes. I called Amazon and they are sending another replacement. My conclusion- Amazon is very efficient and excellent in managing defective products they sell and Timex needs better quality control. I am awaiting the third watch to give Timex another chance because I like the watch design but three strike and they are out.,1
"This product is far less useful than a rock, as a rock can serve as a paper weight, while this trinket isn't worth the postage stamp. I bought six different types of the same watch, and not  a single one of them worked longer than 4 hours total. I wouldn't waste my time even setting the time on this garbage. If you live a warm client and perspire at all, this watch will be completely useless to you. You can't see what time it si while outside during the day. The back plate is made out of chewing gum wrapper, and there isn't a seal between the tinfoil back plate and the casing. Hot Wheels cars that are cheaper than a buck, are made with more care and are of better quality, at least 100 time better quality. Run from this crap.",1
"This watch is really well made. And it does let you freeze time. However, my only complaint is that it's just not expensive enough. How am I supposed to impress my rich friends with a watch that's on sale! Come on Amazon raise the price! We live in a time in which the rich are getting richer every day while the poor are getting poorer. So, in order to impress my rich friends who are all getting richer every freaking day I really need to buy a more expensive watch. My friend Warren makes 37 million dollars a day for gods sake. He could buy 37 of these watches with one day's earnings. So, how am I supposed to impress him with this watch? It needs to cost at least 37 million. Right? I mean seriously... So, I'm going to look around for this watch being sold for a higher price.",1
Very poor quality.I always liked this brand and considered it the best in quality and preciopero no longer ...!! we past two watches I bought this brand have been admitted water.y have been rendered useless ... this model stand just 10 days.<br />I lost money invested in it ..,1
A month into owning it the second hand fell off. Watch no longer works,1
"If you're paying full price for the watch strap, it should come in the ACTUAL Daniel Wellington case. It makes me question if this is a knock off",1
"Keep looking.  I bought this set with the plan two give two watches to my wife and one to my sister in law.  Well guess what, the watch given to my sister in law doesn't work.  She already paid to resize it.  Found out it wasn't working, got a new battery, still not working.",1
the watch is too large for my arm.  The face is huge and the band will go around more than once.,1
"I just received this watch after looking for just the perfect one, and I am SO disappointed.  I wanted something with a little sparkle...there is NONE.  It looks very INEXPENSIVE.",1
"Cheap made,look good in the picture.I did return the order",1
"I bought an U.S. Polo Assn. Sport Men's US9061 Watch with Black Rubber Strap Watch and after normal use the rubber strap got broken, I try to contact U.S. Polo on their web page and sent and email from their web page asking for the rubber strap warranty and they never answer me about it, so the customer service is very poor (very bad) and the material of the rubber strap is poor quality, I don't definitely recommend these watches, bad product and bad customer service.",1
This is a kinetic watch. They are discontinued by Seiko. So this is a very old Kinetic watch. It doesn't work and chances are none of this version of the watch will work. There is a capacitor inside which is charged by motion. If it has sat for over a year and not been worn that capacitor discharges and cannot be recharged. I know I have had two of these watches in the past which no longer work.<br /><br />It's going to cost me $75 plus tax to get repaired by a local jeweler. I suggest of you choose to buy this watch you will need to do the same. I didn't return the watch because I wanted it and the Jeweler assured me after the repair it will be as good as new. The original price on this watch was almost $500 so it was worth fixing.,1
"It does pair with phone and will allow you to play music, keep time, count steps and take calls.  The insane giant problem is that there is no app anywhere to make the watch useful.  I will change this rating massively if seller will please post where app download is.",1
"Within 5 minutes of my daughter wearing the watch, the face fell off! It was very disappointing. I would find a better option.",1
"Not happy with this watch. Flimsy, and not well made. It also arrived broken, the minute hand didn't work and the third party seller had no return policy. The one star is for Amazon's prompt delivery.",1
It's poor quality,1
"I haven't had the chance to see it working.<br />I ordered one and the battery was dead or it was defective. So, I requested a replacement thinking that the shipper would make sure the new one was working. But, it would not work either.<br />What a disappointment !!!!!!!",1
Total junk.  Set the time to the second and after ten minutes of wearing it on my wrist the time was of by six hours...,1
The article came bad. It does not work properly,1
"Shape is good. I left it in the box as a Christmas gift for my wife. After less than one week, the battery is dead. So I have to buy a new battery for it now. IT IS REALLY ANNOYING. The worst experience in Amazon ever!",1
Cannot read the dial.,1
Don't do it!,1
This one is not working.,1
It died within the first week after I received it.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It was cool when it worked though.,1
"This item was listed with the \\""travel alarms\\"" in the Amazon search...it is most definately not a travel alarm.  With shipping...this item is nearly $50.00.  Plastic back...looks cheap.  I was disappointed.",1
"What a Lie. Pretty crappy Altimeter.  This watch doesn't have a true Altimeter like it's advertised.  It uses the Barometric pressure to determine the altitude.. In Miami, we are at/or below Sea Level.. The watch was measuring 200ft about Sea Level the whole time.  Where nowhere in South Florida is that high.  It doesn't truly measure altitude.  Don't buy this watch if you want accurate information.",1
"Very disappointed that i wasted my time and valuable fossil fuel to get this shipped.  Cool, fun watch...and obviously cheaper than the junk that seems to be working at Walmart.  I had to find something else for a stocking stuffer.  However, if it had worked I would have been pleased with it.",1
THE WATCH DOES NOT WORK!!!! I AM STILL TRYING TO GET AN EXCHANGE THROUGH TAMA TIME.FOR THE 2ND. WEEK!!,1
"A pin holding the links together fell out after the plastic wrapping was removed from the band. Thought it odd that tight plastic wrapping was on the band at all-but apparently it was to hold the links in!<br /><br />The latch also faulty. Once open, extremely hard to re-latch.",1
Watch stopped working after 24 hours..Winding mechanism frozen rendering it inoperative...,1
"watch band is made too small and cannot be adjusted so now can not consider any watch from this manufacturer - though the watch design itself, was really beautiful.",1
"Looks nice, but the hands were broken when I got it. I after I wound it up the minute hand was moving along with the second hand it I could see it dragging on the face. Not sure if it happened during shipping, but it was wrapped up rather thick in bubble rap. I also took over 3 weeks to arrive from Hong Kong. Overall the watch is a big as some diver style watches, it's nicely finished, but the band is really cheap.",1
The watch is everything you don't want: difficult to read in daylight not to talk of night when it is simply unreadable.  The worst is it isn't waterproof as advertised; mine went dead at first contact with water. Waste of time and money.,1
"It is difficult to set the time, the instructions were non existent and it fell apart after 1 week...very attractive watch but you get what you pay for",1
"I know it's a cheap watch, but I expected it to last longer than a week. Save up and buy something that lasts.",1
"I rearely if ever write a review of any product but this offering is more then any Breitling lover can take, it has got to be the perfect example of how to ruin a beautiful watch with an after market PVD coating and after market Diamonds. I am sure that thier are some folks out there that are drooling over the watch and I hope they will enjoy it.  Sorry I just can`t help myself",1
Arrived without watch buckles and battery died within 2 weeks,1
"Not waterproof. First time I swam in a pool it took in water, rusted and stopped. Very disappointed.",1
the watch is a pice of crap the 18k Rose Gold-Plated and Stainless Steel band broke 1 month after i got it walking tru the supermarket 3 years ago my mother went ot china and got me a replica of a cartier watch (20 dollar replica) i used for 2 years before it broke this one cost 4 time that and its original no a bad copy amd lasted a month if yo want to buy a watch do not buy invicta its a crapi watch he ones the make the seller is great i love amazon but they are not responsible for the crapi invicta watches they just sell it DO NOT BUY INVICTA IS A PICE OF CRAP,1
"I bought this watch in February of 2014. It lasted three months before the crown broke making the watch worthless! The watch did have a couple of minor scratches since I use it for work in the construction industry. I though the warranty would have covered internal damage. Unfortuanately the warranty from JOMASHOP does not cover anything! They had the watch for a month after finally sending it back with a letter stating that the watch could not be fixed and wasn't covered under the warranty. I am not saying that these are bad watches. Possibly this one was defective but, if you do decide to get this watch DO NOT PURCHASE FROM JOMASHOP! The customer service is terrible and their warranty is worthless! Good luck getting someone on the phone too!",1
"My initial reaction was quite positive as the rubber, or vinyl, or whatever it is is quite soft.  Unfortunately it simply does not hold up well.  As the other reviewer stated, the two strap keepers (why does it need two anyway?), quickly tore off allowing the longer part of the band to flap in the breeze.  I ended up using rubber bands (nice look by the way).  Shortly thereafter all the seams came apart and the band finally had to be put to rest.  Complete waste of money.",1
"Did not fit my size 8 wrist.  Also, the &#34;G&#34; design on the face is too masculine.",1
"Sweep second hand got hung up and would not complete a full rotation. Did not keep time. Broke out of the box.<br />Sent back. I have 3 other Stuhrling watches and have never had a problem prior to this watch. I liked the look and the feel of this watch, but it really needs to perform it's most basic function.",1
"Hello: My experience with this watch, is very bad. It worked for a week, and it has stopped have not managed to make it work again. Attn: Ricardo",1
This watch is very pretty but unfortunately a week after wearing it the battery died. I did get it at a discounted price so I really can't complain to much. It was just a bummer to have to have the battery price along with the purchase price.,1
"Shopping was prompt. However, the watch itself looks cheap and it's poor craftsmanship was evident by the presence of wear marks where the watch band rubs against the watch body. Attempted to return the watch, but the seller expected me to cover the cost of returning their defective product. Since shipping costs would likely be half the price of the watch, I've opted instead to toss the watch and write it off as a lesson learned not to cheat myself by being cheap. If you are looking for a large, heavy watch that looks like plastic, this watch is for you. If not, save your money and put it toward something nice.",1
Can hear it tick from across the room.,1
"The purple watch didn't even work when it arrived, and when I took it to a shop to get the battery replaced, I was told it couldn't be repaired.",1
Very quickly after receiving this watch the band began to fall apart. The Velcro was falling off and was scratching my child. I had to buy her a new watchband from a watch store that cost me an additional $21. Since this is a product manufactured for children they need to make it more durable for the wear and tear a child will put it through. Also it could use a lock feature so bumping it would not turn off the vibrating function.,1
"Had this watch for three years. It is extremely light with a very comfortable band. I love wearing this watch everyday. However, like many of the folks here have noted...the watch is fragile. Mine has needed the movement replaced twice. Going for a G-Shock, I can't see putting anymore money into this watch.",1
"The GOOD: After having bought this watch directly from a Swatch store years ago and losing it, I was quite happy to find out that it was available online.<br /><br />The BAD: The first time it came it failed to have an operational battery so I had to request a replacement.<br /><br />The WORSE: The second time I bought the watch it again came without a working battery and instead of returning it I just bought a replacement myself.<br /><br />The WORST: Now only after a few months, the watch fails to work properly, having stopped multiple times which seems to be even more battery issues.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was not happy with this, especially having experienced how great the watch was when bought directly from a Swatch store.",1
No-no,1
"The hands fell off! Just pray, and pray hard, that it never requires Invicta customer service; because it is non-existent! Twenty eight dollars, plus the cost to ship it to them, to send it in for warranty work on the PLATINUM FIVE YEAR WARRANTY. it takes 8 weeks to a year to get back and the only part of the watch covered is the mechanism. Not what the company leads you to believe that it is covered in entirety.",1
Constantly loses time even when I have it on and moving all the time. If I take it off it stops completely over the weekend.,1
"Disappointing.<br /><br />It is cheaply made.  The underside is sharp.  The metal is so weak, that it is easily deformed.  The links are stiff and non-uniform.",1
"hard to read the time, hard to read all of the other information, even hard to read the instructions!  Sent it back.",1
Didn't work at all.  Said they would send me a new one. Still waiting.,1
I have not received this item and it's been in transit for over a week now.  i can't rate without an item,1
"good morning, i have a big mistake with my watch! i asked for this polo watch U.S. Polo Assn. Men's USC80038 Analogue Black Dial Bracelet Watch but in place of it i received this one U.S. Polo Assn. Men's US9061 Black Rubber Strap Analog Watch.<br />I demand the clock i had order, im really dissapointed. i thought that buying from these sellers would be secure, but now i have another idea and view about it. could you please send me the right watch please?",1
"Not  at all a dive watch,,the description specifically says this is Not diving ,Real scuba shoppes do not even carry invicata products. It is Not a Dive watch ( can not be used for scuba diving especially when your life depends on knowing how long you have been under the water )  Pro, let alone diver, should not even be in the name",1
"Depending on your monitor, this aquamarine watch and band may appear to be a beautiful sky blue. It is not a beautiful sky blue, it is actually really aquamarine, as stated, somewhat like teal. The aquamarine silicone band has a kind of \\""muddy\\"" look to it. It looked (but wasn't) dirty right out of the box. This picture is taken from the Momentum site, so try viewing on a different monitor to see the actual color. I can't speak to the performance of the watch since the one I received was dead on arrival. I had purchased an \\""open box\\"" item that arrived in the manufacturer's packaging from a highly rated Amazon corporate seller. Let's hope their return policy is as good as they claim. Otherwise, all the measurement specs seem fine.",1
"Contacted the seller twice as there are no instructions with the tools. No response from seller. Unless you are trained or in training as a watchmaker, without instructions the tools are useless & the cost of sending them back isn't worth my time & $$$.",1
Looks good but SO big and cannot change size. Cheap feel but looks nice.,1
Today I received my watch and put it in my hand was broken on the part of the clasp.,1
"Dissappointing.  The watch wears almost black.  Strong light has to hit it so you see the blue.  The electric blue actually looks kind of cheap.  Also on the dial there are what seems to be scratches and there are dust particles inside the dial as well.  If you see pictures of this watch on the internet you will notice the dust inside the case.  Not cool.  Another annoying thing is that the crystal scratches EXTREMELY EASILY. Prior to this watch I used a Fossil as my daily beater.  My Fossil is six months old.  My Fossil has a mineral crystal, just like this Blue Mako.  My fossil doesn't have a single scratch.  I have had this Blue Mako for around three weeks and already it has 4 scratches.  I am not rough with my watches at all.  On the contrary I treat them like babies.  Also at my work place they are safe, as I work in an office environment (I am an accountant).  I am telling you this watch scratches just by looking at it.    The bezel worked fine at the beginning and then one day it just suddenly became hard as hell to turn.  I tried oiling it and that didnt work.  Later I took the bezel off and tried to bend the ring to make it smoother.  That didn't work.  The bezel is so hard to turn that it is completely useless.    If there is something good about this watch is that it keeps good time.  But you can get that from a quartz watch at your nearest CVS for $10.    In summary... easy to scratchy crystal, dust inside the dial, almost black instead of blue and a useless bezel.  Bad watch.  I don't recommend.  Seriously I wish I had held this watch in my hand before buying.  At a $100 this watch is cheap alright, and many will say you get plenty for your money.  However I say save your money and get a Seiko a Citizen or something else.  You'll have a better watch. Good luck with your watch hunt!",1
"Just like anyone who gets a watch for a gift, they unwrap it, throw away the box and the wrapping paper and put it on their jewelery box or dresser. She goes to show me that the band was a little loose on her and how it hand no &#34;in-between&#34;. It would either be too tight or too loose. So I say &#34;get a new band tomorrow for it&#34;. Just as I say that, she say's &#34;look, one of the crystals along the dial fell out&#34;. Naturally I ask did you save the box? But no, she didn't so now I guess she has a 100 dollar paperweight for Christmas. 6 Days!  Never Worn! Oh well, never again!",1
Title say's it all ! Watch came to me with a film of ????? on the inside of the crystal.............. Customer service 800 # was a joke.,1
nothing like advertised,1
Product says it's clear & odorless in the description. When we received the product it says it is clear & colorless. It has a strong odor to it. We needed odorless & that I'd why we ordered 2 of these. Buyer beware......description is wrong!!,1
"I was very dissapointed from the moment I took the watch out of its case...  the paint job was terrible, and the strap had a really low quality look...  To make it worst, the watch only worked for about half an hour, then the battery died.  I'm sending it back.",1
Terribly made.,1
I can't figure out how to set the watch so that i can use it. I was super excited to get it because I love the way it looks. It doesn't light up the way it is advertised in the photo,1
This watch arrived broken and i AM very upset,1
The white model is a white granite. It doesn't look anything like the picture. I will be returning the watch unfortunately.,1
It stopped working the first time I used it. Not a good product .,1
Watch is huge and it worked one time to count the calories burned. It actually counts Kcals which you then have to convert. I ended up returning it because it only worked one time on counting the kcals.,1
"I was very disappointed that after only 6 months the casing started showing signs of moisture inside. This was only from hand washing, not swimming or showering. His watch was supposed to be moisture resistant to 99 feet! My husband got this watch frm me as a birthday gift . I am still waiting for a response from Amazon. I expected more from Swisstek!!",1
Looks great but doesn't keep time unless it's worn constantly. Looses time despite sending to Amazon's specialty watch repair location which took months to return only to have the same problem.<br />Disappointed with this purchase.,1
"I was displeased that this *Birthday gift* arrived with a dead battery, but when we replaced that only to learn the lighting system was broken....<br /><br />Better quality from Walmart, I guess I will go there next time.",1
"There are many, many negative reviews on many different models from this company.  Do your homework, before you're tempted by a deal that seems \\""too good to be true\\"".  It doesn't matter if something is designed in Italy, if it's made in some sweat shop with poor quality control.<br /><br />$355.00 MSRP?  These are the kinds of watches you find being sold on streets in Manhattan out of the back of a van.  Not the ones which actually merit more than three hundred dollars.",1
"Cheap product, better off not buying.",1
Bough this as a gift for son.  It stopped working within less than one year.  Lesson learned.  Don't buy inexpensive automatic watches.<br /><br />The band looks good.,1
"Its way too heavy, and kinda huge, you can't have it for more than 2 or 3  hours, because you'll feel that they are a stone in your wrist.  Wish they were bit less heavy and less huge.  The battery dies pretty quick, the best thing that it has, is the case.  I don't recommend it at all.",1
I ordered you strap 20 mm and you sent me a 18 mm and it is small for my watch.<br />I take you 2 times  make order<br />The first time I did not received the parcel. the second time you vyslalai me is not what I wanted.<br />to be sensitive to customers' orders !!,1
"Don't order - I ordered this watch because I thought Casio was a reliable brand name and that the watch would function as described, but I was disappointed that this watch stopped working properly only 2 days after I received it.....i.e. the DAY display is permanently stuck on &#34;Monday&#34; and it cannot be moved to the next day by adjusting it. So now I have a &#34;Monday Watch&#34; that says that every day will always be Monday (how does that song go - I don't like Mondays...ha ha).<br /><br />Also, this is advertised as a MENS watch...but the leather strap seems to be designed to fit a small boy, cos I am not a large man and am only 5'6&#34; and the strap can barely fit my wrist on the last hole of the strap, so the strap is no good for any average man and would only be suitable for small boys.",1
"the reference point , I fail",1
"I saw this watch at Khols for $29.99.  So I searched on line at all the usual places, Target, WM, Khols, etc.  Khols was the only place that carried it and at $30.00 I thought that Amazon could do better.  So when I found it and at half the price of khols, I juumped at the chance, I just didn't think it would take over a month to recieve it.  This was about the middle to late Jan.  I am still waiting.  It was to be a belated Christmas gift for my mom.  Amazon Can and has done better.  There is no excuse for a simple watch to take this long for delivery.",1
"This watch is supposed to be water-resistant. Went to the lake, stayed maybe 15 min in water a the time. Next morning watch had condensation under the glass and seconds are not moving at all, and in 8 hours it fell 2 hours behind. Other then that looks nice, and is a nice watch. Maybe I got a defective one.",1
"Very poor quality, and the camo print is very badly done, nothing like the picture in the description.<br />It is a real scam, beware!",1
"Bad choice of names and somewhat misleading until you read the synopsis which doesn't make sense. I didn't know Russia had divers in 1798? The first diving suits with helmets weren't created till 1837 and scuba gear more than 100 years later. The first scuba dive was in 1942 and not sold until 1943. Maybe they are referring to diving bells but I doubt it. Maybe Capt. Nemo was real and a lot older than was told, or Jacque Cousteau time traveled to 1798?",1
Watch is beautiful as I expected but very very poor quality belt. I was trying first time and belt broke! what a s***ty product. Now searching on internet to replacement belt.,1
No English instructions and couldn't get the time set.,1
need to contact the vendor and my clock does not work on this page the option does not appear to me. the watch is in poor condition does not work. I could help you unlatch manufactures and did not begin to run. Is there warranty on Costa Rica?,1
"I expected this box to be of pretty good quality based on the price and prior reviews. When I received the box, it was nicely packaged  and was not damaged. When I opened up the case for the first time, I noticed that there was lint from the felt or whatever the unbelievably cheap material is that was used to line the box stuck all over the glass and outside. Even when you try to clean the outside of the box the felt just keeps coming back every time you touch it. It gets stuck on your hands and all over your watches.<br /><br />To top it off, the window isn't even glass. Its cheap plastic and scratched as soon as I tried to clean it.<br /><br />Fortunately Amazon is awesome as usual and is allowing me to return this POS.",1
"nice watch, but do not keep time",1
It DOESN'T WORK!,1
"I received this watch as a gift about 5 years ago.  Each year you have to buy an updated schedule for about $10.  Every year that I do that and download the update, it takes several tries before it works.  The USB clip used to update it, which consists of a grip with 5 prongs on it to make contact with 5 connectors on the watch, doesn't always make the proper connection.  This year while updating the schedule my watch program was totally erased and I was unable to download a new schedule to it.  Customer service said to send it in and they will look at it.  They have had it for one month now, and several calls to customer service were fruitless.  They say they will call you back and never do.  Last week they said it was repaired and will be shipped out next day delivery.  Nothing came.  Today they said it was repaired and will be shipped out in 7-10 business days.  The season will be half over by the time I receive it back, if I receive it at all.  While the watch sounded like a good thing, I would never recommend it to anyone.",1
"I just received this item. This is not what the seller described. It does. It have enough room for any watch other than a slim Skagen. My Tag, Omega, Hamilton nor Panerai fits. If you attempt to fit your watch in this case you'll need to push the top down aggressively while putting pressure on your watches face to close the lid. Then the lid pops open very easily. Very disappointed.",1
"Thanks you for asking for my opinion.  As you know, I returned the watch a few days after delivery for a full refund and was most impressed with the speed and hassle free nature of how you handle returns.  When I opened the watch package, I was greeted by three books and a computer disk.  I wanted a good looking watch (which it is) where I set the time and that's about it and instead I got a complex system that was very hard to understand, so to avoid further frustration, back it went.  It would have been helpful to know this was so much more than just a watch and was not for those without the ability to follow detailed and quite frankly hard to understand instructions.  As it was sealed, I never tried the computer disk.  Best,  Don",1
"In September I ordered this watch but received one that doesn't look like the one shown.  I contacted the seller who said that through Amazon's error the wrong watch was pictured, however, it is now December and they have not had the picture removed or changed.  Order at your own risk because I doubt you'll get what's shown here.",1
"The watch is of very poor quality and workmanships, everything plastic and artificial looking.",1
"The watch is beautiful, I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. After she opened it she noticed there was a chip in the watch band, the part with the clasp, so even sizing it wouldn't help. I re-ordered because she loved it. The second one came and as she took the plastic off the watch band it fell apart in her hands. Don't think it was shipping because it was packaged in two boxes.",1
"really nice watch I've got some compliments on it, but yesterday after 1 year and 4 months of using it (not daily use since I have 4 more watches) I found it has some water droplets inside right now I am not really happy about it",1
I had ordered this product considering the looks were good in the picture but in realty its a damn old and bad looking piece. A wrong decision to buy this model as it is not usable by me.,1
I didn´t like although i find it beautiful. Is not water Proof. Today is necessary and very important  to be a water proof. I bought but I did not pay attention to this detail and gave me bad unfortunately.,1
I expected cheap but c'mon man!!!,1
"The watch was a Christmas gift for my son. He loved it and got compliments on it all the time. At about a month, the watch was fast by 1 minute daily. Two more weeks passed, and the watch went to 5 minutes too fast per day, then it ceased to work at all. Six weeks is all it lasted. The last day to exchange it was January 31, 2013. It died February 9th, 2013.Had the watch stayed within a minute per day, I would have given it 4 to 5 stars.",1
"Unfortunately, this was broken when received.  The look of the watch is great.  Just need it to work.",1
"has invicta engraved on the side. Besides that and the magnifier, it would be a nice watch, which invicta does sell for cheaper.",1
Amazon delivered quickly and no problem. The watch is more of a time machine as it is either too fast or too slow. It is a bracelet in terms of accuracy.,1
"Bought this for my wife.  She doesn't like dainty watches so she picked this one out.  She loves it! It's a nice size and weight and is definately eye-catching.  Everything appears to be very high quality.  I will update my review if she has any issues.<br /><br />That was my review when we first received the watch.  After approx 1 month of wear, one of the pieces of ceramic around the dial fell off and a link broke. Cannot return because of policy. What a waste of $$. Very nice looking watch if you only intend to wear on very rare occasions, not every day.",1
it not only looked cheap and felt cheap the necklace was poorly crafted and worst of all it was just thrown in a bag not in the box shown in the picture,1
My pin fell.out after wearing it only a week very disappointed in this product can't replace it either,1
"I 100% agree with the comment that was posted earlier, which I posted below!  It also did not come with two rubber pieces to hold the extra length down, only one.  Extra length sticks out way to far and I will be forced to cut it!  Not like the original at all!<br /><br />&#34;Not the same band. Even though it has the same part number.<br />BySteve Alexanderon April 29, 2015<br />Verified Purchase<br />This band has a stop that protrudes out of the sides. It prevents the keeper from moving too far.<br />It is located too far in. It holds the tail of the band in place. Now the band kind of unwinds and the tail sticks out.<br />It looks like the solution is to cut the excess strap off. I didn't pay the additional money for the OEM. To find out I could have purchased a cheap knock off. Disappointed.&#34;",1
"I bought this timex watch for my students to practice time skills, but it broke within the first few days!",1
THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED AND SATISFACTION BUT WELL TWO DAYS TO USE THE CLOCK IS SOLTO BY ITSELF OF MY HAND. BRACELET came off ASIDE.<br />ME LOOK VERY BAD.,1
"I had to request a refund because the quality was so poor. Everything that could look bad on it, did look bad... and honestly I wasn't expecting much to begin with, so it had to be pretty awful to make me go through the hassle of returning it and paying for the return shipping. I would not have paid $12 for this watch. To be fair, it should be noted that the seller offered me a discount to keep it, as well as a prompt refund.",1
Been looking for an automatic watch and thought this was attractive so I ordered it.  When it arrived it was way bigger than how I pictured it.  Then when I turned the watch over I saw that the back of the watch was badly cracked.  Had no problem with customer service about sending it back though with their prepaid label.,1
We chose this pendant watch because there is not much out there.<br />My wife has nerve trouble and can't wear a watch.<br />We received it in normal time and it did not work at all.<br />Had to return it for refund. That went well.<br />This company is in switzerland but watch is chinese.<br />It says swiss made on it but it is not. Not nice!!!!!!!!,1
"Beware of warrenty issues.  I love this watch and would purchase the same model again, but I would not advise purchasing a Victorinox from Amazon.  Victorinox does not honor their warrenties when an item is purchased through Amazon.  So, my lovely watch that gets so fogged-up that it is difficult to read the time whenever it gets wet, is a big disappointment.  Save yourself some frustration and purchase this watch through a dealer that is able to honor the manuafacturer warrenty.",1
This watch is a baby watch.<br />Please don't be fooled!,1
It's was so small and cheap looking. I didn't like it at all. It felt like a kids watch. Skip it.,1
"Nice looking watch. But, Battery was dead on arrival.  Very disappointed so 1 star.",1
"This watch induces meteorological activity. The skies darken and thunder clapped when I picked it up at the post office. The black guy behind the counter in his little blue hat with an eagle on it told me to vacate the premises when I made it outside, I realized I was walking on the ashes of civilization. The sun and moon were rising and setting with a sense of urgency. Fire hydrants broke, babies were screaming. Shoes were coming off. All hell had broken loose. Pompeii doesn't have sh*t on this epic event. Upon my arrival home, a sinkhole in my backyard had consumed my hibiscus plant. Those things are hard to find at Lowe's. I looked down and my skin was starting to welt green from too much gastric activity. It had to be from the watch, though I wasn't totally sold at this point. I'm afraid this watch caused the tornadoes in Tuscaloosa, AL and the cruise ship in Italy to tump over. Polar magnetism is disrupted when the wearer of this timepiece doesn't know the answer to the Daily Double on Jeopardy. Airplanes go down around the house and all compasses act a little funny. I think I'm going to bury this watch in my enemy's yard. Next to the sinkhole that my watch has created.<br /><br />P.S. did I mention that the roof of my house collapsed and be sure not to wear this piece....I'm forced to leave now. I cannot finish the review....they're coming for me....recession proof",1
"As you can read with the other reviews poor quality is a huge issue with this watch.  I had the watch 2 days and it malfunctioned, It took 3 calls to Nixon (I finally got  a hold of the customer service supervisor)to get them to  issue a repair order.  When I took the watch to the post office to Mail it back to Nixon  the person behind me saw my box and laughed, he had the same watch and had to send it back  twice.    The Nixon Lowdown is a very good looking and comfortable watch, however for $90 you would think Nixon  could invest in quality and customer service.  Be warned:  1. Many retailers will no longer take returns on Nixon Watches  2. If you have to return the watch to Nixon they require you to give them a credit card on ALL returns    3. This watch is complicated to set  4. The small print on the instructions tells you not to press the buttons underwater - an important detail   Good Luck",1
Got the watch today. As soon as I looked the watch I was so happy.  But soon I realize that it is not working...lets see how much amazon returns me,1
"The watch did not meet my expectations, end up selling it on craigslist. Its a good looking watch is the only positive.",1
"I bought this because it is advertised as a child's watch, it is definitely not child sized.  I am disappointed.  It did fit on my 8 year old's wrist at the smallest setting.  He wore it for 1 day and then the digital display stopped working.  I checked and it wasn't the battery because it was still keeping time.  I took it to a watch repair shop and they quoted $100 to fix it.  Returning!",1
"Either it shipped with no battery, or with a non-functional battery... won't know 'til we take it to a jeweler. But for the moment, it's just a big bracelet.",1
"This beautiful watch was purchased for my wife in July of 2011 and is being returned to the Seiko service center for the third time because it, occasionally, simply stops keeping time or the day/date feature doesn't work.  Seiko service personnel have been quick to repair and return the timepiece, but the fixes haven't worked, thus far.  We're expecting a replacement, not a repair, or a total refund. [Update]:  Three weeks have passed since we received this watch back from Seiko.  Same timepiece--- hopefully fixed.  As of this date (12/31/11), the wristwatch is keeping accurate time and date.  Our fingers are crossed...",1
I thought that this was a large pocket watch for a man but turned out to be a ladies small necklace.,1
I do not like the look of the Mickey Mouse on this watch. He doesn't look like any Mickey Mouse I've ever seen and he isn't cute. I would not purchase this item because of this fact.,1
"Materialism involves the importance one attaches to their worldly possessions. For a materialist, possessions are central to his or her life in that he or she feels that increased \\""consumption\\"" increases his or her satisfaction with life. Materialism may become a problem in situations where the physical goal of consumption overshadows all other goals of self and development. This does not imply that all material desires are bad. In fact, the acquisition of material possessions may begin to interfere with other important aspects of life. At that point, materialism is likely to become harmful to the person or to society. What is the relationship of materialism to individuals' ethical beliefs? Do consumers who are more materialistic have different ethical standards than those who are not? On one hand materialism may increase a society's economic wealth and material possessions. On the other hand, there are those who would argue that materialism has a negative overall effect on the quality of life. Possessions can be the focus of one's life, becoming more important than religion, friends, and achievements. In making possessions the majority component for achieving happiness, the more materialistic person might be willing to bend ethical rules to gain possessions.<br />What is it that makes us want something so badly? Certainly many marketers have an interest in perpetuating materialism, and as the issue of marketing's social responsibility grow in significance, the topic of materialism surfaces. While many marketing efforts encourage materialism, the materialism that is encouraged may have negative societal effects. Materialism is associated with a greater drive to acquire the goods that marketers provide for consumers. If consumers move away from their focus on material acquisitions and towards non-material quality of life concerns, then they will consume less, leaving the marketers with fewer consumers and less demand for their goods. Though this may be an enormous explosion in the camp of those marketers who provide services that are purchased to increase the quality of life, it would certainly have a negative impact on those companies that provide the goods which feed a materialistic quest. Generally, marketers know the essence of their motivation. They have a goal in mind. However, if they see that what they are manipulating to achieve is wrong, will they abort, or will they proceed with their plans just for their own success? Plato suggests that there is a knowing within us that already exists to help us quickly and easily conform to what we see, but turns in the opposite direction, causing us to look away from what we see (Plato 518). In essence, act like what we see really isn't there. So, many marketers may have self-interest in encouraging materialism. But if materialism is not in the best interest of society, then such encouragement could be considered socially irresponsible.<br />Plato states that there are virtues of the soul that could be developed, just as you can develop your body by exercise, like the virtue of wisdom which always remains, could be useful, profitable, or hurtful and useless (519). Seems like we juggle these virtues and drop them (the ones we want to ignore) on cue. On one hand, materialism may lead to lower ethical standards. As a person starts their materialistic quest, people, religion, values, etc., seems to become less important as possessions become the focus of his or her life. So, when faced with an ethical choice, the acquisition of the goods may begin to take priority over ethical values. Not to mention that fact that the confinement or constraints of time may compound this. Meaning, there is a drive to acquire more and more things, but there is only a limited time to do so, and shortcuts may mean ethical compromises. A materialistic person may be less likely to take the ethical high road when doing so means sacrificing or even waiting to obtain the material things he or she so deeply desires. On the other hand, it could be argued that people who are less ethical tend to be more materialistic. As one strives to meet their social and/or spiritual needs, their focus often at times moves from things to people. In contrast, when one focuses on material possessions, such social and/or spiritual needs begin to take a back seat to acquiring possessions. Concern for others and/or spiritual convictions often, though certainly not always lead to higher ethical standards.<br />Does the way we were raised have anything to do with our materialism? Plato believes there is a relation between the sensual pleasures afforded to us in our youth and our exposure or our lack of exposure as it relates to the \\""character\\"" of our soul. According to Plato, certain tendencies when we were young, and certain gratifications (even eating and drinking), which like heavy weights came with birth, had the ability to bring us down, and turn our affections to subservient and menial things (519). Are we targeted by marketers in our youth? If so, it does raise some interesting issues as it relates to the social responsibility of marketers. If encouraging materialism also encourages lower ethical standards, then it could be certainly argued that it is not in society's best interest to encourage such materialism. If marketers do encourage materialism, knowing that it will result in the additional burdens of society associated with lower ethical standards, then it could also be argued that they are acting in a socially irresponsible manner. However, implications also exist to the opposite (i.e. being less ethical tends to make a person more materialistic). Though encouraging materialism here would not lead to lower ethical standards, it would amount to appealing to those holding lower ethical standards. This could be assumed by some as condoning or even encouraging such lower ethical standards.<br />In conclusion, people who are more materialistic seem to show less concern for ethical issues. Although this does not necessarily mean all people who are materialistic have low ethical standards. Indeed, it is possible and maybe even likely that many materialistic people do have great concerns for ethical issues. However, on average, those being more materialistic do show less concern for ethical standards. In addition, the possibility does exist that causing one to become more materialistic may also cause him or her to have lower ethical standards. If this is indeed the cause, then it could be argued that it is socially irresponsible for companies, at some point, to sell their products by encouraging materialism.",1
"In my opinion, The time is hard to see because the screen is dark! It is not worth it for $1xx :(",1
"Very pretty, my child loved it, but too poor quality too, it lost the hand 10 after purchased!!<br />Not worth the money.",1
"Sellar Said This Was A Men's Watch, When It Is A Unisex Watch. I Have No Problem With Wearing A Unisex Watch, But This One Had Such A Small Band, That It Barely Fit On My Wrist, And I Have An &#34;Average&#34; Sized Wrist. I Returned This Sucker Right Away. I Was Disappointed To Learn That $ 5.00 Was Deducted From My $36.00 Purchase For Using The Pre Paid Label!",1
I wore this for a day and it's already scuffed. I didn't scrape it against anything either. I'm currently returning it.,1
"CHEAP, not worth my time even reviewing!!!!!",1
"Really liked this, I wore it once and it broke.",1
used!!!! returned it!,1
"I love the look of this watch.  Exactly what I want with the day and date in a beautiful dress watch.  I saw that the reviews were not good but took a chance.  I returned the first watch and the replacement because neither changed the day and date properly.  I am very disappointed.  From reviews of other Armitron watches I believe they work fine - what is different with this one?  Very, very disappointed.",1
"I love Timex watches. However, most Timex watches have a setting to turn the \\""beeps\\"" off. On this particular model, there appears to be no setting to turn the \\""button press beep\\"" off. This makes it inappropriate for 90% of the settings I am in - work, school, and group settings. Next time, I'll be sure to check the 1-star reviews before I buy a Timex watch.",1
"Was looking forward to getting this watch, a bit of xmas gift for myself. It arrived in this very nice felt lined box with all the paper work telling me hold good it was going to be to own one of these fantastic watches. I give it a little shake ( it is an automatic) nothing..another shake..nothing. Read the instructions...yep pretty simple...shake it once more...absolutely nothing! So my excitment turned to dismay.....DOA!!!...So there is not a lot to review about it! Looks like a great watch...but was all show and no go. I actually chose the green version as it had good reviews(as opposed to the blue one). I guess this will the first not so good review for the green version. Just makes me wonder for a DOA, what type of quality control do Stuhrling undertake???. Not a lot by  the looks. Well watch has been sent back to Amazon..hopefully for refund very soon. Maybe I just got a dud and I must admit, the outward appearance, style and price of the watch, it is tempting me to take another punt.....but I am not sure if I want to be part of the 'twice bitten twice shy' brigade!! Apart from the parlava associated with the return of the item and my pending refund...",1
"I own several nice men's Fossil brand watches (Relics parent company) and have been happy with all of them.<br /> I'm going to start with the problems, because if a watch doesn't function, then its purely jewelry.<br />First, the biggest problem is apparently a design flaw that allow moisture to enter the watch. I suspect moisture is entering through the &#34;stem&#34;. Once inside, this will cause a fogging effect under the watch face that comes and goes . I have not submerged this watch at all, I have washed my hands with the watch on without running water directly on the watch.<br />  This is the second Relic watch of this style that has done this condensation, the other being a silver banded version of same watch. My wife had to return that one to a local department store. I thought I would give this one another try since I liked the watch concept and looks.<br />  The complete deal breaker is now the watch will not keep time. It will stop after a fews hours even after manually winding the spring.<br />I did notice the band on the version &#34;squeaks&#34; after a few days of wear. I put a little oil in  between the links and it went away.<br />  All in all, the watch had such promise but it falls short in functionality. I think those of us who like the automatic concept would at least want a working watch.",1
